# Spectron
### The NextJS Starter kit for Disgruntled Developers.

Spectron brings together the best tools for full-stack web development into one place to allow projects to move faster and forget about writing boilerplate code.


## What makes up Spectron

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) : The most popular and probably most controversial react framework , designed to help developers ship larger apps faster than ever before

[Better-Auth](http://better-auth.com) : Simple and Effective Auth Solution. The spiritual successor to Lucia Auth. Providing you with the toolkit to contain your own auth but making it easier

[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) : The typescript orm from the future (imo).An ORM that allows all your code to exist in typescript and doesn't require a generation step , go from schema to query instantly.

[Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) : Build with consistent components every single time. Build your own theme system from day 1


## Why Spectron ?
Well I've spawned a lot of projects in my time as a developer and over time , writing the same boilerplate code over and over again takes the fun out of projects , so I create starter projects of my favourite tools to work with that already have the boiler plate in place meaning I don't have to write them and can instead dive right into the project itself.
