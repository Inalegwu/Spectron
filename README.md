## What makes up Spectron

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) : The most popular and probably most controversial react framework , designed to help developers ship larger apps faster than ever before

[Lucia-Auth](http://lucia-auth.com) : Simple auth solutions for developers who are either tired of being sold kinde-auth or clerk-auth and want to roll their own , or developers who have constraints that don't allow for third party auth services

[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) : The typescript orm from the future (imo).An ORM that allows all your code to exist in typescript and doesn't require a generation step , go from schema to query instantly.

[Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style) : Make building your design system for your project easier if you don't want to use all of ShadCN/UI or other projects but want to build a more bespoke system.


## Why Spectron ?
Well I've spawned a lot of projects in my time as a developer and over time , writing the same boilerplate code over and over again takes the fun out of projects , so I create starter projects of my favourite tools to work with that already have the boiler plate in place meaning I don't have to write them and can instead dive right into the project itself.
